My name is Joanna.  By the end of this lesson, I should be more comfortable about the absolute basics of Git.  I should be able to know how to create a new respository and clone it on my terminal.  I should be able to know how to create a file and edit it.  I should be able to follow the workflow and their respective commands to get from directory, staging, and respository.  This has been really challenging to learn if I must be honest.  I have already had to use gitter for help on installing the terminal with WSL and git bash.  Then I decided to use VS Code, and I spent a lot of time playing around with it and goolging what to do along with the Odin Project lessons.  I'm actually pretty proud of myself for getting this far.  I can't wait to keep going and learn more!
